# My Book Store

A web-based application that allows users to add, view, and delete books using form inputs and a remote API. This project was created to demonstrate DOM manipulation, form handling, and async JavaScript using `fetch()`.

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


---

## Prerequisites

To run this project, youâ€™ll need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any code editor)
- [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (optional but useful)


---

## Installing

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-project.git
cd bookstore-project
```

### 2. Open `index.html` in your browser

You can also use the Live Server extension in VS Code:

```bash
Right-click on index.html â†’ Open with Live Server
```

### 3. Add a new book

Fill out the form with a **Title**, **Author**, and optionally a **Publisher**, then click `Add Book`.

### 4. Delete a book

Click the `Delete` button next to any book entry to remove it from both the UI and the API.

---

## Running the tests

This project doesn't use a formal test framework, but here are the behaviors you can manually verify:

### test examples

- Add a book and verify it appears in the list.
- Delete a book and verify it disappears from the list and API.

Example:

```js
addBookToTable({
  title: "Atomic Habits",
  author: "James Clear",
  publisher: "Avery"
});
```

### Coding style check

- Code follows clean formatting and naming conventions.
- Uses `async/await` and `try/catch` for error handling.
- Uses `setAttribute`, `createElement`, and `addEventListener` for DOM interaction.

## Deployment

You can deploy this app using:

### GitHub Pages

1. Push code to GitHub repo.
2. Go to Settings â†’ Pages.
3. Set source to `main` branch and root folder.
